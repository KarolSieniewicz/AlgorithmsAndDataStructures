# AlgorithmsAndDataStructures
Projects from my Algorithms And Data Structures course on IT in Gdansk University Of Technology.


EXPLANATION

Projects go as follows:

1 - user inputs two integers and the algorithm writes out possible combinations of sums consisting of the second int and prime numbers in a non-increasing order that give the first int
2 - a basic object oriented implementation of a list data structure
3 - an algorithm that solves games of TicTacToe based on the input current game state and the minimax algorithm
